 * @brief Header for GX state management, handling VRAM bank allocations for Nintendo DS graphics.
 *
 * This module provides functions to initialize and manage the allocation of VRAM banks for various
 * graphics components such as backgrounds, objects, textures, palettes, and clear images on both
 * the main and sub displays. It maintains a global state of current allocations and provides methods
 * to set, reset, disable, and query VRAM bank usage. The functions interact with hardware registers
 * to configure VRAM mappings for different graphics subsystems.
